            <h3>Early life of Sardhar vallabhai patel</h3>
            <p>
                Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat.
                He followed Vaishnavism and belonged to Pushtimarg sect of Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya and took the diksha from the descendant of Vallabhacharya.
                Patel's date of birth was never officially recorded; Patel entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers.
                He belonged to the Leva Patel (Patidar) clan of Gurjar community of Central Gujarat, although after his fame, both Leva Patel and Kadava Patidar have claimed him as one of their own.

            <h3>Fight for Independence</h3>
            <p>
                In September 1917, Patel delivered a speech in Borsad, encouraging Indians nationwide to sign Gandhi's petition demanding Swaraj – self-rule – from Britain.
                A month later, he met Gandhi for the first time at the Gujarat Political Conference in Godhra.
                On Gandhi's encouragement, Patel became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, a public body that would become the Gujarati arm of the Indian National Congress.
                Patel now energetically fought against veth – the forced servitude of Indians to Europeans – and organised relief efforts in the wake of plague and famine in Kheda.
                The Kheda peasants' plea for exemption from taxation had been turned down by British authorities.
                Gandhi endorsed waging a struggle there, but could not lead it himself due to his activities in Champaran.
                When Gandhi asked for a Gujarati activist to devote himself completely to the assignment, Patel volunteered, much to Gandhi's delight.
                Though his decision was made on the spot, Patel later said that his desire and commitment came after intense personal contemplation, as he realised he would have to abandon his career and material ambitions.

            <h3>Satyagraha in Gujarat</h3>
            <p>
                Patel , supported by Congress volunteers Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Abbas Tyabji, Vallabhbhai Patel began a village-by-village tour in the Kheda district, documenting grievances and asking villagers for their support for a statewide revolt by refusing to pay taxes.
                 Patel emphasised the potential hardships and the need for complete unity and non-violence in the face of provocation response from virtually every village.
                 When the revolt was launched and tax revenue withheld, the government sent police and intimidation squads to seize property, including confiscating barn animals and whole farms.Patel organised a network of volunteers to work with individual villages, helping them hide valuables and protect themselves against raids. Thousands of activists and farmers were arrested, but Patel was not.The revolt evoked sympathy and admiration across India, including among pro-British Indian politicians.
                 The government agreed to negotiate with Patel and decided to suspend the payment of taxes for a year, even scaling back the rate.
                 Patel emerged as a hero to Gujaratis.In 1920 he was elected president of the newly formed Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee; he would serve as its president until 1945.
